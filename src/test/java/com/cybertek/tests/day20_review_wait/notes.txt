   *iframe review?
      page in page, html inside another html
     -How do you handle iframes?
         we need to switch to <iframe> to be able to do any action on any web element inside of it

      - How many ways do you know to switch
           3 ways
           1. index
                   driver.switchTo().frame(0)
           2. id, name
                   driver.switchTo().frame(name or id)
           3. WebElement
                 WebElement iframe = driver.findElement(By.Locator);
                 driver.switchTo().frame(iframe);


     * TestBase
           parent of all the tests in our framework, by extending our test cases we can easily


      * Actions review
           Actions Class: is used for "advanced" mouse and keyboard actions
           * How to use Actions
             1. Create an object of Actions Class
             2. Pass "driver" object as a parameter
             3. Use the Object to reach actions method
             4. We must use perform() method to do the action


      If you have a WebElement that disappears


      *POM page object module review
          What is Page Object Model Design Pattern
             We create JAVA classes for our each page of the project
             We are storing useful WebElements(reusable), methods
          How do we implement POM Design
              constructor: PageFactory class from selenium
              gets two parameters: driver object, this (points to the object of the specific class)
          Advantages:
              - Reusability
              - easy to maintain
              - easy to explain non-technical person
              - handles StaleElement exception, it checks for freshness of the element

      * New Topic: Explicitly wait
      PIQ: How do you handle synchronization in Selenium?
      What is synchronization?
              Moving, working, operating at the same time
              in movies voice and picture do not operate together
              men(from Mars) and women (from Venus)

      In Web Automation: JAVA is fast, web page is slower, we need to handle this synchronization problem otherwise our code will break.

      1. Static Wait: Thread.sleep method from JAVA--- BrowserUtils.sleep method
                I put 2 seconds for my test, my friend clones the project, but 2 seconds not enough for him.
                Environmental problem, maybe the internet is slower

      2. Dynamic Waits:
              * Implicit Wait( applies to all elements of the project, you need to define one time)
              * Explicit Wait
                      can be used under certain condition
                                    - wait until element is visible
                                    - waits until element is clickable
                      Does not depend on the wait time of Implicit wait
                      only applies once in that line that is used
